# AnimalVision tool

Simple streamlit application with very basic deep learning model (based on EfficientNet) that can identify animals in images. The tool is made when learning about computer vision. 
Could serve as a basis for other applications. The model is built using transfer learning. This repo also contains the data (images) that the model is trained on. 

## Usage

Clone git repo:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: \venv\scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: due to the presence of image data in this repo, the process can take a while. 

Create virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: \venv\scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Train your model:
```bash
python train.py
```

Open application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Note: the training of model and starting of the streamlit app should happen with the environment being activated.
